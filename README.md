# AP Physics C Final Project
**Video Instructions and Project Explanation:** 

## Installation:

Follow the installation instructions under **ICBM Simulator** in releases on the right of this page. 
If you get an "Unknown Developer" error, you have to right click the app and click open to force it to run.

## Information:

For our final project, we created an ICBM simulator. This simulator allows the user to pick a rocket (including DPRK - Nodong-A, DPRK - Nodong-A1, DPRK - Nodong-B, DPRK - TD-1, DPRK - TD-2, Germany - V2, Israel - Jericho-I, Israel - Jericho-II, Israel - Jericho-III, Iran - Qased2, Iran - Qased5, Iraq - Al-Husayn, Russia - Scud-B), these missiles have well-known specs and are used across the board for most educational simulations (as we found while researching on them) for which the payload weight, RV diameter, total nozzle area, nosecone (length/diameter), and missile diameter are built in and will appear when the user selects one. The user must also put in the dimensions they want for the fins (including number of fins, fin span, sweep angle, fin tip chord, fin root chord, and fin thickness). The trajectory type, nosecone type, estimated range, and number of stages must also be inputted through the parameter page.

Once the program is run, it will output different data about the rockets, using the physics equations we found/derived and coded into our simulation. For this output, the simulation will switch to the results page. The data includes apogee, apogee velocity, range, and flight time. It also includes the velocity, angle, height, range, and time for each of the different stages.

This program therefore uses Python2 and key physics equations to predict the trajectory of a rocket with the properties inputted by the user. Therefore, the user can learn about the trajectory of the rocket through the data produced by the simulation. This simulation will therefore allow the user to learn about the way rockets work due to physics through testing their own sets of different data and different rockets.
