## Installation:

Our code relies on something called Anaconda to run. It is important that Anaconda is installed on your system as well as all the dependencies before you can run our code.

### Step 1: Download Our Code:

Download or clone our code from github.



### Step 2: Run the Following Commands:

Please do these steps in order to install dependencies for our program.
MacOS does not allow users to run shell files by double clicking because that is a security loophole that can make it very easy to conduct an attack. Becuase of this, we will be using the "chmod" command to set the .sh file as executable and then running the .sh file via the command line. The rest will be done automatically.

  - Type "cd " (with a space and then drag the folder that was downloaded on your computer into the terminal window and press enter (this will change the active directory to that folder to make it easier to do the rest, which is pretty basic)
  ``` 
  cd [drag and drop folder that got downloaded here]
  ```
  - Run these commands by copy pasting the following into your terminal together and hitting enter:
  ``` 
  chmod +x install.sh
  bash install.sh
  ```
  
## Running the Code:

All you have to do to run the code is copy paste the following line into your terminal after making sure you are in the directory associated with the folder containing the code. To get into that directory or if you are unsure if you are in that directory just drag the folder into an empty terminal session and hit enter.

  ``` 
  bash run.sh
  ```
